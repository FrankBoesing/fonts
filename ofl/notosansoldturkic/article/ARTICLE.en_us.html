<h4>Orkhon runic (Old Turkic)</h4>
<p>
  Orkhon runic (Old Turkic) is a historical Central Asian alphabet, written
  right-to-left or boustrophedon. Was used in the 8th–13th centuries in Mongolia
  and Siberia for Turkic languages. Earliest examples discovered in 1889 on the
  banks of the Orkhon river. Superficially similar to Germanic runes and to Old
  Hungarian. Read more on
