<h3>Supported writing systems</h3>
<h4>Korean Hanja</h4>
<p>
  Korean Hanja (<span class="autonym">한자, 漢字</span>) is an East Asian
  logo-syllabary, written left-to-right. Based on traditional Chinese Han
  characters, Hanja was used for the Korean language until 1446, when King
  Sejong introduced Hangul. Until the mid-20th century Hanja and Hangul were
  used in parallel or mixed. Today, the vast majority of Korean text uses Hangul
  but Hanja is still used in some context, and schools teach some 1,000-3,000
  Hanja symbols. Read more on

  ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds
  of various languages. Read more on

<h4>Greek</h4>
<p>
  Greek (<span class="autonym">Ελληνικά</span>) is a European bicameral
  alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek
  language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like

  distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century
  BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have
  positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in
  meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be
  written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece
  introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support
  for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
