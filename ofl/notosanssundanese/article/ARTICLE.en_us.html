  Sundanese (<span class="autonym">ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ</span>) is a Southeast Asian
  abugida, written left-to-right. The standard form (Aksara Sunda Baku,
  <span class="autonym">ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮘᮊᮥ</span>) is used on the Indonesian island
  Java since 1996 for the Sundanese language (27 million speakers), and is
  derived from Old Sundanese script (Aksara Sunda Kuno,
  <span class="autonym">ᮃᮊ᮪ᮞᮛ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮥᮔ</span>) used in the 14th–18th centuries.
  The Sudanese language also uses Latin script. Needs software support for
  complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
