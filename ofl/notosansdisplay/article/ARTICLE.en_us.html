<h3>Supported writing systems</h3>
<h4>Latin</h4>
<p>
  Latin (Roman) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. The
  most popular writing system in the world. Used for over 3,000 languages
  including Latin and Romance languages (Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish
  and Romanian), Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Nordic languages),
  Finnish, Malaysian, Indonesian, Filipino, Visayan languages, Turkish,
  Azerbaijani, Polish, Somali, Vietnamese, and many others. Derived from Western
  Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous
  European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian
  religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the
  Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters,
  ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds
  of various languages. Read more on

<h4>Cyrillic</h4>
<p>
  Cyrillic is a bicameral alphabet originating in Europe, written left-to-right
  (250 million users). Used for various languages across Eurasia and is used as
  the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic and Iranic-speaking
  countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia,
  North Asia and East Asia, including Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian,
  Ukrainian, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Bashkort, Chechen,
  Chuvash, Avar, Dargwa, Kabardian, Karakalpak, Kumyk, Lezgi, Ossetic, Pontic,
  Yakut, Buriat and many others. Created in the 9th century. Traditionally
  attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki working in Bulgaria, after
  earlier creation of the Glagolitic script. Sometimes attributed to Clement of
  Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyril’s. Initially used for Old Church Slavonic.
  Reformed in 1708 by Russian tsar Peter the Great. Extended by the Soviet Union
  in the 20th century to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and
  Asia (some of those languages switched to Latin after 1991). Read more on

<h4>Greek</h4>
<p>
  Greek (<span class="autonym">Ελληνικά</span>) is a European bicameral
  alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek
  language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like
  Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in
  scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with
  distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century
  BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have
  positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in
  meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be
  written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece
  introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support
  for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
