  Buginese (Lontara, <span class="autonym">ᨒᨚᨈᨑ</span>) is a Southeast Asian
  abugida, written left-to-right. Was used since the 17th century for the Bugis,
  Makasar, and Mandar languages of Sulawesi in Indonesia (over 7 million
  speakers). Largely replaced by the Latin alphabet during the period of Dutch
  colonization, but still used for ceremonial, personal and traditional texts.
