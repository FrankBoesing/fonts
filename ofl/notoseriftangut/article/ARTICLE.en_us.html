  Tangut (Xixia, <span class="autonym">𗼇𗟲</span>) is a historical East Asian
  logo-syllabary, written vertically left-to-right. Was widely used in China in
  1036–1502 for the now-extinct Tangut language. Superficially similar to
  Chinese writing, but not related. Had almost 6,000 characters. Read more on
