  Runic is a historical European alphabet, written left-to-right or
  boustrophedon. Used in Northern Europe in 150–1000 CE for Germanic languages.
  The Scandinavian variants are also called Futhark or Fuþark. Derived from Old
  Italic. Gradually replaced with the Latin script. Still used for specialized
  purposes, by occultist, mystic, and esoteric movements, and in fantasy
  literature. Read more on
