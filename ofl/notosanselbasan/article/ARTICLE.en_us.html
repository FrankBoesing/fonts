<h4>Greek</h4>
<p>
  Greek (<span class="autonym">Ελληνικά</span>) is a European bicameral
  alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek
  language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like
  Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in
  scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with
  distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century
  BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have
  positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in
  meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be
  written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece
  introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support
  for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
