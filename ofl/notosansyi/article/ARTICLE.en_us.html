  Yi (Modern Yi, <span class="autonym">ꆈꌠꁱꂷ</span>) is an East Asian
  logo-syllabary, written horizontally left-to-right (modern) or vertically
  right-to-left (traditional). Used for the Nuosu Yi language (2 million users)
  in the Liangshan Yi region of China. Yi signs are made from five basic
  strokes; dot, horizontal line, vertical line, arch and circle. Attested 500
  years ago, believed to be use for perhaps even 5000 years. Needs software
  support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
