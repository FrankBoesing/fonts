  Deseret (<span class="autonym">𐐔𐐯𐑅𐐨𐑉𐐯𐐻</span>) is a historical American
  bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. Was used by members of the Church
  of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) in Utah for writing the English language.
  Developed in 1854 by George D. Watt as part of a planned phonemic
  English-language spelling reform. Abandoned around 1877. Read more on
