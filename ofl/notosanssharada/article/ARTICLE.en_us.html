  Sharada (<span class="autonym">𑆯𑆳𑆫𑆢𑆳</span>) is an Indic abugida, written
  left-to-right, partially with a headstroke. Used in c. 700–1950s for Kashmiri
  and Sanskrit, first throughout India, later only in Kashmir. Now used only by
  the Kashmiri Pandits for religious and ceremonial purposes. Needs software
  support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
