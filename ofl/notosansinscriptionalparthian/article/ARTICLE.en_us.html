  Inscriptional Parthian is a historical Middle Eastern abjad, written
  right-to-left. Was used around 250 BC in today’s north-eastern Iran for the
  Parthian language, and, along with Inscriptional Pahlavi and Psalter Pahlavi,
  for other Iranian and Indo-European languages. Needs software support for
  complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
