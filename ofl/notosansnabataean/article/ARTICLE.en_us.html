  Nabataean is a historical Middle Eastern abjad, written right-to-left. Was
  used in northern Arabia and the southern Levant in the 2nd century BCE–4th
  century CE for the Nabataean language. Derived from Aramaic, evolved into the
  Arabic script. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read
