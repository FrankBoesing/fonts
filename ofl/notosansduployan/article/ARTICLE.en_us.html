<h4>Duployan shorthand</h4>
<p>
  Duployan shorthand (Sloan-Duployan shorthand, Duployan stenography) is an
  American alphabet, written left-to-right. Geometric stenography script created
  in 1860 by Father Émile Duployé for writing French, later expanded and adapted
  for writing English, German, Spanish, Romanian, and Chinook Jargon. Heavily
  cursive (connected), allows words to be written in a single stroke. Praised
  for simplicity and speed of writing. Needs software support for complex text
  layout (shaping). Read more on
