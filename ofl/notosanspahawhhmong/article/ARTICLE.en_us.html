<p>
  Pahawh Hmong (<span class="autonym">𖬖𖬰𖬝𖬵 𖬄𖬶𖬟 𖬌𖬣𖬵</span>) is an East Asian
  syllabary. Used in China, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand for the Hmong language
  (over 0.2 million speakers). The script as a whole is read left-to-right but
  each syllable is written right-to-left. Created in 1959 by Shong Lue. Hmong is
  also written in the Romanized Popular Alphabet by William Smalley. Needs
  software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
