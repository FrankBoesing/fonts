<h4>Caucasian Albanian</h4>
<p>
  Caucasian Albanian is a historical European bicameral alphabet, written
  left-to-right. Was used in the 5th–12th century CE for the Caucasian Albanian
  language, a dialect of Old Udi, in parts of present-day Azerbaijan and
  Dagestan. Probably based on Greek writing, supposedly devised by Mesrop
  Mashtots. Has 52 letters. Read more on
