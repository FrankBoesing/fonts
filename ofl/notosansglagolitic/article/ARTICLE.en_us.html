<p>
  Glagolitic (Glagolitsa, <span class="autonym">Ⰳⰾⰰⰳⱁⰾⰹⱌⰰ</span>) is a
  historical European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. Created around
  863 CE, traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a monk from Thessaloniki
  working in Bulgaria. The oldest known Slavic alphabet. Was used throughout the
  Balkans in tandem with the later-created Cyrillic until the 13th century,
  after which time it was largely replaced by Cyrillic. In Croatia, Glagolitic
  continued to be used until the 19th century, particularly in the church. Needs
  software support for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
