  Sogdian (<span class="autonym">𐼼𐼴𐼶𐼹𐼷𐼸‎</span>) is a historical Middle Eastern
  abjad, written right-to-left. Was used in 7th–14th centuries CE, alongside
  Manichaean and Syriac, for the middle Iranian Sogdian language spoken in parts
  of today’s Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and China. Needs software support
  for complex text layout (shaping). Read more on
